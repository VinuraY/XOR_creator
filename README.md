# XOR_creator
My XOR creator is a C-based tool designed for both encryption and decryption using the XOR cipher. It takes input data and a key, applying the XOR operation to scramble the data for encryption. The same process, using the same key, is then used to decrypt the data back to its original form. It's a straightforward and efficient way to protect your data!

Try it now by typing ./main in your terminal.(Remeber one word each time)
